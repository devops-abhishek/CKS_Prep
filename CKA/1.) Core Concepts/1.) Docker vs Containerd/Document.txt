Container Runtime Engine :
    Docker
    Containerd

Earlier kubernetes and docker was tightly coupled. But later Container Runtime Engine is loosly coupled as Kubernetes comes with Container Runtime Interface, so they can adhere with Open Container Initiative(OCI) - imagespec and runtimespec 

Kubernetes uses dockershim as a hack to work with Docker as a Container Runtime Engine

Docker comes with - CLI, API, BUILD, VOLUMES, AUTH, SECURITY, containerD

ContainerD is CRI compatible

K8s 1.24 remove dockershim completely.

Commands:
#ctr images pull <Image>
#ctr run <Image> <Container_Name>

Alternate Tool:
nerdctl provides Docker-like CLI for Containerd
nerdctl support docker compose
nerdctl supports newest features in containerd
    Encyrpted container images
    Lazy Pulling
    P2P image distribution
    Image signing and verifying
    Namespaces in kubernetes

crictl is developed by Kubernetes team
crictl provides a CLI for CRI compatible container runtimes
Installed separately
Used to inspect and debug container runtimes
    Not to create containers ideally
Works across different runtimes
#crictl
#crictl pull image
#crictl images
#crictl ps -a
#crictl exec -it container-id bash
#crictl logs container-id
#crictl pods
